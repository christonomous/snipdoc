# Snippet Documentation
This documentation is about any snippets I find very regulary usefull and get to know, so I collect those right here.

> This documentation may has issues. I am very new to programming, so I have not much experience. But I have much administrations skills - sourcecode is not new to me and I always update my systems ;)
